# Adventure-Work-Sales-Analysis

‎The goal of my analysis was to create a visual representation of the data to assess the performance of the Company (Adventure) over the years, 
specifically concentrating on the analysis of products, customer locations (countries) & time trends to identify patterns or trends.
‎‎I made use of one analytic tool which is EXCEL to perform all tasks ranging from data cleaning to data visualization. 
‎During the process of analyzing, I learnt how to use Power Query in Excel which was easier to perform my analysis without the use of formulas and
‎functions.
